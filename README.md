This is a simple microserver that implements a REST API to manage users and projects on the MOC's
OpenShift clusters.  It is intended as an demostration of how to make a service available to users of the MOC.

Currently this implments the following:

    1) user account
       a) existance
       b) creation
       c) deletion
    2) project existance, creation, deletion
       a) existance
       b) creation
       c) deletion
    3) managing roles (admin, member) of a user on a project
       a) existance
       b) creation
       c) deletion
